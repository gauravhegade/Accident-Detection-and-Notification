GETTING OUTPUT CLASS, USING THAT INFORMATION TO FURTHER THE RASPBERRY PI PROCESS

FURTHER PROCESS:
1. get the class, if moderate or severe sound buzzer send notification to concerned
2. save the detected frame and a few seconds of that video stream that shows the accident and include it with the notification to be sent


1. GETTING CLASS
> output a result vector to watch values
> extract meaningful information from the result vector such as the class index and the confidence score
> if the confidence score is as desired (set a threshold to avoid false positives (conf < 0.5 ignored)) proceed further

2. Sending Notification and sounding buzzer
> buzzer logic - if moderate/severe is the detected accident class and the confidence score is desirable, send power to the buzzer on the output pin that has been chosen
> sending notification (use open source libraries ig?)
